  VisibleField class
  This is the data that's being displayed at any one point in the game (i.e., visible field, because
  it's what the user can see about the minefield). Client can call getStatus(row, col) for any 
  square.  It actually has data about the whole current state of the game, including the underlying
  mine field (getMineField()).  Other accessors related to game status: numMinesLeft(), 
  isGameOver().  It also has mutators related to actions the player could do (resetGameDisplay(),
  cycleGuess(), uncover()), and changes the game state accordingly.
  
  It, along with the MineField (accessible in mineField instance variable), forms the Model for the
  game application, whereas GameBoardPanel is the View and Controller in the MVC design pattern.  It
  contains the MineField that it's partially displaying.  That MineField can be accessed
  (or modified) from outside this class via the getMineField accessor.
